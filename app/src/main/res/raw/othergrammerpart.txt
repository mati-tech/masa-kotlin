2. Articles:

3. Conjunctions (Additional Information):
   - Coordinating Conjunctions: Join words, phrases, or clauses of equal importance (e.g., and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet).
   - Subordinating Conjunctions: Connect independent clauses to dependent clauses to show a relationship between them (e.g., because, although, if, when, while).
   - Correlative Conjunctions: Work in pairs to join words or groups of words (e.g., either...or, neither...nor, both...and).
